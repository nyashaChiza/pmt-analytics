## Background

The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a strategic planning and management system used extensively in business and industry, government, and non-profit organizations worldwide. This project analyzes 10 years of BSC data to provide insights and predictive capabilities to enhance performance management.

## Objectives

- Develop predictive models to forecast future performance.
- Identify key performance drivers and inefficiencies.
- Create interactive dashboards for real-time performance monitoring.
- Provide actionable insights for resource allocation and strategic planning.

## Data Description

The dataset includes 10 years of Balanced Scorecard data, covering:
- Employee performance metrics
- Objectives and their weighted contributions
- Tasks associated with each objective
- Task statuses (in progress, complete)

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- Collected BSC data for 10 years, including employee performance metrics, objectives, and tasks.

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values and standardizing formats.
- Transformed data by normalizing and encoding categorical variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized data distributions and relationships.
- Identified trends, patterns, and key insights through EDA.

### Modeling

- Selected and trained machine learning models, optimized through hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluated models using cross-validation and appropriate performance metrics.

### Model Deployment

- Deployed the best-performing model using Flask.
- Integrated the model with business systems for real-time predictions.

## Results

- Improved performance prediction accuracy by X%.
- Developed interactive dashboards reducing performance review time by Y%.
- Identified key performance drivers, increasing overall productivity by Z%.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Flask)
- **Visualization Tools**: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Flask, Vercel
- **Other Tools**: SQLite, Jupyter Notebooks, Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyashaChiza/pmt-analytics.git
   cd pmt-analytics
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv pmt-env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. Train the models:
   ```bash
   python src/modeling.py
   ```

3. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run.py
   ```

4. Access the interactive dashboard:
   ```bash
